## [Unreleased]

### Added

* Added a host-neutral Core policy evaluator contract and default policy evaluator implementation.
* Added a decision policy extension point for raising composed decisions to deferred, acknowledgment-required, or escalation-recommended outcomes.
* Added an audit sink contract for writing audit residue without requiring a database or web host.
* Added an in-memory audit ledger project for local validation, samples, and tests.
* Added end-to-end policy evaluator tests covering allow, deny, warning, acknowledgment-required, escalation-recommended, deferred, and not-applicable constraint scenarios.
* Added policy evaluator pipeline documentation and a minimal in-memory usage example.

### Boundaries

* The evaluator remains framework-neutral and does not depend on ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, robotics packages, database providers, or AI model hosting.
* The in-memory ledger is non-durable and intended only for tests, samples, and local validation hosts.
