# Governance

This document describes how the **AsiBackbone** project is governed: who makes
decisions, how those decisions are reached, how contributions are triaged, and
when releases happen. Transparency and consistency are the guiding principles.

**AsiBackbone** is a stable governance-infrastructure library. Its primary purpose
is to serve as a reference implementation and conceptual anchor for accountable
decision-flow in .NET systems.

The project values clarity, accountability, and minimalism — preferring explicit
boundaries over implicit behavior.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Core Maintainers

Core Maintainers have write access to the repository and carry final
responsibility for the project's direction, quality, and community health.

| GitHub Handle | Area of Responsibility |
|---|---|
| *@cdcavell* | Architecture, API design, CI/CD, infrastructure, documentation, community |

> **Becoming a maintainer:** Regular contributors who demonstrate sustained
> quality contributions, sound judgment, and alignment with project values may
> be nominated by any existing maintainer. Confirmation requires a simple
> majority vote among current Core Maintainers with no active objections after a
> 7-day comment period.

> **Bootstrap governance note:** While the project has fewer than two active
> Core Maintainers, the current Core Maintainer may handle routine changes,
> routine releases, security releases, and governance updates after documenting
> the decision in the relevant issue, pull request, or security advisory.

### Triagers

Triagers have permission to label, assign, and close issues and pull requests,
but do not merge code. This role is designed to reward active community members
and reduce maintainer bottleneck.

### Contributors

Anyone who opens an issue, submits a pull request, improves documentation, or
participates in discussion is a Contributor. No formal application is required.
All contributions are subject to the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

See [Contributing to AsiBackbone](CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on contributing.

### Emeritus Maintainers

Former Core Maintainers who have stepped back from active duties. Their
expertise is welcome in discussions but they hold no voting rights.

---

## Decision-Making Model

AsiBackbone uses a **Consensus-Seeking with Fallback Vote** model.

### Everyday decisions

Changes that fall within an existing, documented design (bug fixes, doc
improvements, dependency updates, test additions) may be merged by any Core
Maintainer after:

- At least **one approving review** from a Core Maintainer other than the
  author, and
- CI checks passing (all required status checks green).

### Significant decisions

Changes that introduce new public APIs, alter the project's architecture,
modify governance, or affect the release strategy require:

- A **GitHub Discussion** or issue opened with the `proposal` label,
- A **minimum 5-business-day** comment period,
- **Lazy consensus**: if no Core Maintainer raises a blocking objection within
  the comment period, the proposal is considered accepted.

### Disputed decisions

If consensus cannot be reached:

1. Any Core Maintainer may call a **formal vote** by adding the `vote-open`
   label to the discussion.
2. Each Core Maintainer casts one vote (`+1` / `0` / `-1` with a required
   written rationale for `-1`).
3. A **simple majority** of votes cast decides the outcome.
4. Ties are resolved by the longest-serving active Core Maintainer.
5. Results are documented in the discussion thread and linked from the relevant
   PR or issue.

### Veto & escalation

A `-1` vote is not a veto by itself — it triggers discussion. If a Core
Maintainer believes a decision would cause irreversible harm to the project,
they may invoke a **48-hour hold** (comment `HOLD: <reason>`) during which no
merge may occur. After 48 hours, the normal voting procedure resumes.

---

## Triage Workflow

New issues and pull requests are processed within **3 business days** of
opening. The triage owner (any Triager or Core Maintainer) applies one of the
labels below and takes the corresponding action.

### Issue labels

| Label | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `bug` | Confirmed defect | Assign priority (`P0`–`P3`); link to milestone if applicable |
| `enhancement` | Feature request | Move to `proposal` workflow if significant; label `good-first-issue` if small |
| `question` | Usage question | Answer or link to docs; close after resolution |
| `duplicate` | Already tracked | Link to canonical issue; close with comment |
| `wontfix` | Out of scope | Explain decision; close |
| `needs-info` | Waiting on reporter | Auto-close after 14 days of no response |
| `good-first-issue` | Suitable for new contributors | Keep unassigned until claimed |

### Pull request labels

| Label | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `needs-review` | Awaiting maintainer review | Assigned to an available Core Maintainer |
| `needs-changes` | Author action required | Author must push or respond within 14 days |
| `blocked` | Waiting on external factor | Document blocker in comment; revisit weekly |
| `ready-to-merge` | Approved; CI green | Any Core Maintainer may merge |
| `do-not-merge` | Hold per governance | Must remain until explicitly removed by a maintainer |

### Stale policy

* **Issues:** Marked `stale` after **60 days** of inactivity; closed after a
  further **14 days** without response.
* **Pull requests:** Marked `stale` after **30 days** of inactivity; closed
  after a further **14 days** without response.
* Stale items may always be reopened with new information.

---

## Issue and PR Ownership

* The **author** of a PR is responsible for keeping it up-to-date with `main`,
  responding to review feedback, and resolving conflicts.
* A PR may be **adopted** by another contributor if the original author does not
  respond within 14 days of a review request; adoption requires a comment
  notifying the original author.
* Core Maintainers may **close any PR** that has been abandoned (no author
  response for 30+ days) or is irreparably conflicting with the project
  direction, with a written explanation.
* **Issue ownership:** Issues are not assigned unless a contributor explicitly
  states they are actively working on it. Assignments lapse after 21 days of
  inactivity; maintainers may reassign or remove the assignment with a comment.

## Release Cadence and Release Readiness

AsiBackbone follows **Semantic Versioning 2.0.0** (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`). The
release process should be practical and humble: a stable package line means the
project is making a documented compatibility promise, not that every consumer
scenario has already had a long real-world feedback window.

The detailed release-process article is [Release Cadence and Readiness](docs/articles/release-cadence-and-readiness.md).

### Release stream guidance

| Stream | Default use | Appropriate changes | Review expectation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Patch** (`x.y.Z`) | As needed | Bug fixes, security fixes, documentation corrections, packaging fixes, NuGet metadata fixes, README/package icon corrections, Source Link metadata fixes, SBOM/provenance workflow fixes, and validation hardening that does not expand the stable public surface. | Release PR and release-readiness record. No new public API or package/namespace identity change. |
| **Minor** (`x.Y.0`) | Approximately every 8 weeks when there is additive value | Backward-compatible public APIs, optional providers, additional templates, compatible durable-artifact additions, and provider improvements that preserve existing consumers. | Proposal-driven when the feature affects architecture, public API, provider boundaries, or release strategy. API compatibility review required. |
| **Major** (`X.0.0`) | Only when strongly justified | Package identity changes, namespace changes, public API breaks, stable package boundary breaks, incompatible durable-artifact changes, or dependency-direction changes that cannot be shipped compatibly. | Significant-decision process, migration documentation, release-readiness stabilization plan, and explicit maintainer approval. |

Patch releases may happen close together when correcting release-facing issues
that cannot be changed after publication, such as NuGet metadata, package icon
assets, repository URLs, README packaging, Source Link metadata, SBOM/provenance
artifacts, or documentation links. Even then, the release notes should explain
why a patch is appropriate and confirm that no public API expansion or breaking
change is intended.

### Current stable-line posture

`3.x` is the current stable package identity line for the `AsiBackbone.*`
package IDs and namespaces. Additional breaking changes should be avoided unless
strongly justified by consumer safety, correctness, maintainability, or a clearly
documented architectural boundary that cannot be preserved compatibly.

Future work should prefer compatible patch or minor releases on the current stable line.
Any proposal that would create another package identity, namespace, or public API
break should explain why the change cannot wait, why a compatibility shim is not
sufficient, and what consumer migration support will be provided.

### Stabilization window after major releases

After a major release, maintainers should favor a stabilization window before
broadly recommending the line for cautious consumers. During that window, the
project should prioritize:

- package metadata and asset correctness;
- documentation currency and migration clarity;
- consumer smoke tests and sample verification;
- Source Link, SBOM, and provenance validation;
- issue triage for migration blockers;
- patch-only corrections when the public contract can remain unchanged.

A major line may be described as the recommended line once release-blocking
workflows pass, published packages are visible, the documentation site is current,
post-publish checks are completed or explicitly deferred, and no known migration
blocker remains unresolved.

### Pre-release checklist expectations

Before tagging a stable release, the release PR or release-readiness record should
confirm:

- version metadata is updated consistently across build, citation, Zenodo, release
  notes, changelog, and generated package filenames;
- package metadata assets are inspected, including package icon rendering,
  packaged README presence/rendering, package IDs, descriptions, tags, license
  metadata, project URLs, repository URLs, and documentation links;
- Source Link repository commit metadata is generated and has a post-publish
  validation plan when packages must be downloaded from NuGet to verify it;
- package SBOM and provenance artifacts are generated, uploaded, and attested
  where the workflow event supports attestation;
- the stable package list, API compatibility promise, assembly-version policy,
  and provider/package boundary wording are current;
- release notes distinguish fixes, additive changes, and breaking changes;
- any deferred release-critical check is documented with the accepted risk and
  follow-up issue.

### Package identity and namespace changes

Package identity or namespace changes are major-release events. They require at
least:

- a proposal or issue explaining the reason for the identity change;
- a migration guide with old package IDs, new package IDs, old namespaces, new
  namespaces, and representative `PackageReference` / `using` updates;
- release notes that call out the breaking boundary in the first release of the
  new line;
- README and documentation updates that identify the canonical package line;
- compatibility notes for the previous line, including whether it is superseded,
  deprecated, supported only for security fixes, or retained only for historical
  traceability;
- external consumer smoke tests or sample validation that exercise the new
  identity from a clean project;
- an explicit stabilization note for cautious adopters when the new line is young.

### Release process

1. A Core Maintainer opens a **release PR** that:
   - Bumps the version in all relevant files,
   - Updates `CHANGELOG.md` with entries since the last release,
   - Adds or updates release notes and the release-readiness record,
   - Confirms the pre-release checklist above,
   - Ensures all release-blocking CI checks pass.
2. At least **one other Core Maintainer** reviews and approves the release PR.
3. The merging maintainer creates an **annotated Git tag** (`git tag -a vX.Y.Z`)
   and pushes it; CI publishes the release artifact automatically.
4. A **GitHub Release** is created, with the changelog excerpt as the body.
5. If Zenodo integration is enabled, the tagged release is archived for DOI minting according to Zenodo's processing timeline.
6. Post-publish validation is completed or documented, including NuGet visibility,
   package metadata inspection, Source Link metadata validation, documentation
   links, and any package/SBOM/provenance artifact checks that depend on
   published artifacts.

> **Note:** AsiBackbone should continue to prioritize stability, documentation
> clarity, security patches, and carefully scoped refinements. New feature work
> should be proposal-driven and evaluated against the project's
> governance-infrastructure boundaries.

### Security releases

Security patches (`x.y.Z`) that address a CVE or private disclosure bypass the
standard review window and may be merged by any two Core Maintainers. The
`SECURITY.md` coordinated-disclosure process governs notification timelines.

## AI-Assisted Development Policy

**AI-assisted tools may be used in this project to accelerate development, documentation,
and refactoring, but all contributions remain human-reviewed and human-owned.** Maintainers
are responsible for validating the correctness, originality, and appropriateness of any
AI-generated code or text before it is merged. AI tools do not make architectural decisions,
define project direction, or act as authors of record; they serve only as optional assistants.
All final contributions must reflect intentional human judgment, align with the project’s
governance boundaries, and comply with the repository’s licensing and contribution requirements.

---

## Amendments to This Document

Changes to `GOVERNANCE.md` are **significant decisions** and follow the
5-business-day proposal process described above. The resulting PR must include
an updated changelog entry and must be merged by a Core Maintainer other than
the one who opened it.
