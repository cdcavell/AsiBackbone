**Accountable Systems Infrastructure for governed .NET decision flow.**

> AI may provide the intellect. AsiBackbone provides the accountable spine.

## Documentation ownership

`AsiBackbone/AsiBackbone` is the source of truth for the concrete product: package installation and configuration, public APIs and type behavior, runtime semantics, integration boundaries, security posture, operations, compatibility, releases, and maintainer evidence.

For organization-level concepts, architecture education, terminology lineage, tutorials, comparisons, tradeoffs, labs, and general governed-execution teaching, use [ASI Backbone Learning](https://asibackbone.github.io/Learning/) and its [source repository](https://github.com/AsiBackbone/Learning) as the canonical educational source. Learning does not define or override released AsiBackbone package, API, configuration, or runtime behavior.

See the [cross-repository documentation ownership contract](docs/articles/documentation-ownership.md) for the full routing matrix.

## The practical problem

Most software can tell you *what* happened. Far less can show that an action was evaluated before it executed: which rules shaped the decision, which policy version applied, whether acknowledgment was required, how follow-on authority was scoped, and where the host took responsibility for execution.

AsiBackbone is a .NET package family for that decision boundary. It helps a host application build safe policy context, evaluate constraints, return a structured decision, preserve a decision receipt, optionally scope continuation, and then let the host decide whether and how to execute.

In this software project, **ASI** means **Accountable Systems Infrastructure**.

## Implementation-first mental model

A normal API adoption path looks like this:

```text
HTTP request
  -> host builds safe evaluation context
  -> host-owned rules evaluate the request
  -> AsiBackbone returns a GovernanceDecision
  -> host writes audit residue / decision receipt
  -> host continues only when decision.CanProceed is true
```

Use plain engineering translations first:

| Project term | Practical meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Governance spine | Policy decision pipeline around consequential operations. |
| Audit residue | Decision receipt or audit-log payload. |
| Acknowledgment handshake | Confirmation workflow before a risky operation. |
| Capability grant | Short-lived scoped permission. |
| Governance outbox | Durable outbox pattern for governance events. |
| OpenTelemetry projection | Optional traces/metrics projection after local records exist. |
| Host-owned execution boundary | The application code that performs or refuses the protected operation. |

## First code path

The snippet below is an intentionally small README slice, not a complete `Program.cs`. It shows the primary governance path: build safe context, evaluate policy, write audit residue, and let the host execute only after the decision allows it. The full compile-ready walkthrough lives in [First 15 Minutes: Standard API Gating](https://asibackbone.github.io/AsiBackbone/articles/quickstart-api-gating.html).

```csharp
// Registration: Core evaluator + one host-owned rule + local in-memory audit sink.
builder.Services.AddAsiBackboneAspNetCore();
builder.Services.AddSingleton<InMemoryAuditLedger>();
builder.Services.AddSingleton<IAsiBackboneAuditSink>(sp =>
    sp.GetRequiredService<InMemoryAuditLedger>());
builder.Services.AddSingleton<IAsiBackboneConstraint<AsiBackboneConstraintEvaluationContext>, AllowedRegionConstraint>();
builder.Services.AddSingleton<IAsiBackbonePolicyEvaluator<AsiBackboneConstraintEvaluationContext>>(sp =>
    new DefaultAsiBackbonePolicyEvaluator<AsiBackboneConstraintEvaluationContext>(
        sp.GetServices<IAsiBackboneConstraint<AsiBackboneConstraintEvaluationContext>>(),
        decisionPolicy: null,
        options: new AsiBackbonePolicyEvaluatorOptions()));

app.MapPost("/api/orders/{region}/approve", async (
    string region,
    HttpContext httpContext,
    IAsiBackbonePolicyEvaluator<AsiBackboneConstraintEvaluationContext> evaluator,
    IAsiBackboneAuditSink auditSink,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken) =>
{
    var metadata = new Dictionary<string, string>(StringComparer.Ordinal)
    {
        ["operation"] = "orders.approve",
        ["region"] = region,
        ["risk"] = "routine-api-write"
    };

    var context = new AsiBackboneConstraintEvaluationContext(
        correlationId: httpContext.TraceIdentifier,
        policyVersion: "policy-v1",
        policyHash: "policy-hash-v1",
        metadata: metadata);

    GovernanceDecision decision = await evaluator.EvaluateAsync(context, cancellationToken);

    AuditResidue residue = AuditResidue.FromDecision(
        AsiBackboneActorContext.Human("example-user", "Example User"),
        operationName: "orders.approve",
        decision,
        metadata: context.Metadata);

    await auditSink.WriteAsync(residue, cancellationToken);
    if (!decision.CanProceed)
    {
        return Results.Json(new
        {
            allowed = false,
            decision = decision.Outcome.ToString(),
            decision.ReasonCodes,
            auditEventId = residue.EventId
        }, statusCode: StatusCodes.Status403Forbidden);
    }

    // Host-owned execution starts here. AsiBackbone does not approve the order itself.
    return Results.Ok(new
    {
        allowed = true,
        message = "Host order approval would run after this governance decision.",
        auditEventId = residue.EventId
    });
});
```

The `4.x` evaluator defaults are intentionally fail-closed for governed surfaces: empty policy structures deny, eligible ordinary constraint exceptions deny with `asibackbone.policy.constraint_exception`, and threat-contributor exceptions deny. Set `TreatConstraintExceptionAsDenial = false` only when a host intentionally wants fail-fast exception propagation through its own exception, transaction, retry, telemetry, or incident-response boundary.

For production-style hosts, add durable audit/outbox persistence, signing or verification, DLP/classification, provider emission, and operational monitoring only where the host has explicitly chosen and configured those boundaries.

## Package family

Stable `5.1.x` package family. `5.1.0` is the current release. It is a
backward-compatible stabilization release that adds automated public API
compatibility baselines, documented repository security and branch-retention
controls, security-advisory distribution tooling, and public support and
maintainer policies. Package IDs, public namespaces, runtime behavior, and the
binary assembly identity `5.0.0.0` remain unchanged.

Consumers upgrading from `4.0.0` should review the [5.0.0 migration guide](https://github.com/AsiBackbone/AsiBackbone/blob/main/docs/articles/upgrade-400-to-500.md); hosts that persist the affected enums as integers need a data migration.

| Package | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `AsiBackbone.Core` | Framework-neutral governance primitives: decisions, constraints, threat-model contributor hooks, acknowledgments, audit residue, lifecycle events, governed execution receipts, capability-token abstractions, explicit capability-grant validation profiles and proof trust pinning, durable outbox contracts, provider-neutral emission contracts, DLP/classification policy primitives, signing-ready metadata, canonical hashing/signing seams, verification-policy primitives, policy evaluator options, metadata budget helpers, and builder-style audit residue construction. |
| `AsiBackbone.DependencyInjection` | Explicit `AddAsiBackbone(...)` builder facade for coordinating host-selected provider registrations without making Core own infrastructure. |
| `AsiBackbone.Storage.InMemory` | Non-durable in-memory storage helpers for tests, samples, local validation, lifecycle events, and outbox proof paths. |
| `AsiBackbone.EntityFrameworkCore` | EF Core model configuration and host-owned persistence for audit ledger, acknowledgments, lifecycle events, JSON metadata storage, and governance outbox records. |
| `AsiBackbone.AspNetCore` | ASP.NET Core host adapters for actor context, conservative actor-type claim mapping, request correlation, audit enrichment, HTTP result mapping, acknowledgment challenge flows, endpoint governance, endpoint metadata mode, strict-governance profile helpers, endpoint fast-abort metadata, and hosted outbox drain integration. |
| `AsiBackbone.Testing` | Test-only harness helpers for deterministic endpoint governance, policy results, capability validation, in-memory audit inspection, non-durable outbox storage, and no-signature signing seams. |
| `AsiBackbone.Templates` | `dotnet new` templates for generating governed ASP.NET Core host scaffolds with endpoint governance, sample policies, local in-memory audit inspection, analyzers, and README guidance. |
| `AsiBackbone.Analyzers` | Roslyn analyzer safety rails for governance persistence and continuation flows. |
| `AsiBackbone.OpenTelemetry` | Released OpenTelemetry governance emission provider that projects provider-neutral envelopes into .NET diagnostics. |
| `AsiBackbone.Signing.LocalDevelopment` | Local-development signing and verification for tests, samples, and wiring proof paths only. Not for production key custody. |
| `AsiBackbone.Signing.ManagedKey` | Provider-neutral managed-key signing adapter boundary. The host supplies the actual managed-key client, credentials, key operations, verification path, monitoring, and operational policy. Production-oriented registration fails closed by default when signing cannot complete. |

Runtime governance-residue signing remains provider-neutral through `AsiBackbone.Signing.ManagedKey`. AsiBackbone does not ship first-party Azure Key Vault, AWS KMS, GCP Cloud KMS, HSM, certificate-store, enterprise KMS, or production-style signing sample-host implementations. Future Event Hubs, Purview, gateway, robotics, immutable-storage, or other non-signing provider packages are not part of the stable contract unless separately reviewed and released.

## Supported target framework

Stable `5.x` packages intentionally target `net10.0`. Consumers should plan on a .NET 10 SDK/runtime or later for the current package line.

The project is not multi-targeting .NET 8 for `5.x`. That is an explicit adoption decision, not a defect workaround. The current package family uses a single repository-wide `TargetFramework` of `net10.0`, the EF Core integration is aligned with centrally managed EF Core `10.0.x` dependencies, and backporting the full package, analyzer, template, CI, packaging, and smoke-test surface would add compatibility overhead for a short-lived adoption window.

If meaningful external consumer demand appears, additional TFM support can be reconsidered in a later release with CI, packaging validation, analyzer compatibility, template smoke tests, and documentation updated together. See the [Target Framework Support Decision Record](https://github.com/AsiBackbone/AsiBackbone/blob/main/docs/articles/target-framework-support.md).

## Choose your path

Use the organization as one connected path; each repository has a distinct job:

1. **Learn the pattern:** start with [ASI Backbone Learning](https://asibackbone.github.io/Learning/)
   for concepts, tutorials, labs, comparisons, and adoption personas.
2. **Try a complete host:** use
   [NetCoreApplicationTemplate](https://github.com/AsiBackbone/NetCoreApplicationTemplate)
   when you want a production-oriented ASP.NET Core baseline to evaluate or adapt.
3. **Adopt the packages:** return here for the
   [implementation-first path](https://asibackbone.github.io/AsiBackbone/articles/implementation-first-adoption.html),
   install only the `AsiBackbone.*` packages your host needs, and validate one
   low-risk governed operation before expanding.

Already evaluating or using the project? See the public [adopter registry](ADOPTERS.md)
and use its report form to share permission-based adoption evidence or feedback.

## Current status

Stable `5.x` is the current released line, with `5.1.0` as the current release. Package IDs and public namespaces remain unchanged, and the binary assembly identity is `5.0.0.0`.

The stable API contract is documented in [API Compatibility and SemVer](https://github.com/AsiBackbone/AsiBackbone/blob/main/docs/articles/api-compatibility-and-semver.md). The current release is recorded in [5.1.0 Release Notes](https://github.com/AsiBackbone/AsiBackbone/blob/main/docs/articles/release-notes-510.md). Consumers can use the [5.1.0 Consumer Verification Guide](https://github.com/AsiBackbone/AsiBackbone/blob/main/docs/articles/consumer-verification-510.md) for package-source, API-baseline, Source Link, SBOM, provenance, and deferred-signing checks. Consumers moving from `4.x` should also follow the [5.0.0 Migration Guide](https://github.com/AsiBackbone/AsiBackbone/blob/main/docs/articles/upgrade-400-to-500.md). Earlier release records remain available for historical traceability.

- See [Adopters](ADOPTERS.md) for public adoption evidence and the opt-in reporting path.

## Relationship to NetCoreApplicationTemplate

NetCoreApplicationTemplate may be used as a preferred host baseline during development and validation, but AsiBackbone does not require it.

```text
NetCoreApplicationTemplate = preferred host baseline
AsiBackbone               = optional governance/module package family
Consumer application      = chooses whether to use either or both
```

A consumer should be able to use AsiBackbone in an application generated from NetCoreApplicationTemplate, in an existing ASP.NET Core application, or in a custom host that provides the required infrastructure. See [NetCoreApplicationTemplate Host Validation](https://github.com/AsiBackbone/AsiBackbone/blob/main/docs/articles/netcoreapplicationtemplate-host-validation.md).

## Alignment boundary

AsiBackbone is a governance spine, not an intelligence engine. It implements governance-oriented software primitives for accountable decision flow and keeps execution authority with the host application. See [Project Boundaries and Non-Claims](https://asibackbone.github.io/AsiBackbone/articles/project-boundaries.html) for the full scope statement and safe wording guidance.

> **Current NuGet packages are intentionally published without package signing.** The dated [NuGet Package Signing Decision Record](https://asibackbone.github.io/AsiBackbone/articles/nuget-package-signing-decision.html) records the accepted risk, compensating controls, mandatory review date, and early re-evaluation criteria. The project publishes durable release-attached SBOMs, package/SBOM provenance, Source Link metadata, and package hashes as distinct trust signals; none is presented as a signed-package guarantee. For current verification guidance, see the [**5.1.0 Release Notes**](https://asibackbone.github.io/AsiBackbone/articles/release-notes-510.html) and the [5.1.0 Consumer Verification Guide](https://asibackbone.github.io/AsiBackbone/articles/consumer-verification-510.html).

## Design principles

- Keep Core small.
- Keep Core dependency-light.
- Avoid hidden host assumptions.
- Prefer explicit integration over magic.
- Let the host own infrastructure.
