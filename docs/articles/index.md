# Documentation Articles

This section maps the AsiBackbone documentation set for the stable `3.x` Accountable Systems Infrastructure package family.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In this software project, **ASI** means **Accountable Systems Infrastructure**. AsiBackbone is governance infrastructure for accountable software decision flow, not an artificial superintelligence implementation. See [Project Boundaries and Non-Claims](project-boundaries.md) for the canonical boundary reference.

## Search and navigation

Use the header search box for package names, API concepts, and article titles. Search is enabled for the published DocFX site; if a newly merged page is missing from results, wait for the documentation publish workflow to finish and refresh the browser cache. Long pages use the left navigation tree and the right **In this article** rail for local heading navigation. Source files live under `docs/` in the repository, and the site header includes a Repository link for source review or edits.

## Current stable package posture

Stable `3.x` is the current package line. `3.0.0` establishes the current major line and binary assembly identity while preserving the `AsiBackbone.*` package IDs and namespaces established by the `2.0.0` public rename from `CDCavell.AsiBackbone.*`.

Released stable package surfaces include Core, DependencyInjection, Storage.InMemory, EntityFrameworkCore, AspNetCore, Testing, Templates, Analyzers, OpenTelemetry, Signing.LocalDevelopment, and Signing.ManagedKey. OpenTelemetry is the concrete released governance-emission provider. Event Hubs, Purview, Azure-specific SDK adapters, Aspire runtime packages, robotics, immutable-storage, and additional provider packages remain design-only, strategy-only, sample-only, host-owned, or future-provider work unless a later stable release explicitly ships them.

The release process includes explicit [Release Cadence and Readiness](release-cadence-and-readiness.md) guidance for patch/minor/major release selection, early-major stabilization, package metadata assets, Source Link, SBOM/provenance, documentation links, and future package identity or namespace changes. The [3.0.0 Consumer Verification Guide](consumer-verification-300.md) gives consumers a conservative package-source, package ID, Source Link, SBOM/provenance, and deferred-signing verification path.
