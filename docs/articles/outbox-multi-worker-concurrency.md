# Outbox Multi-Worker Concurrency Guidance

This article records the current concurrency review for the provider-neutral governance outbox drain, the in-memory outbox store, and the EF Core-backed outbox store.

The goal is to help hosts avoid accidental duplicate emissions when an ASP.NET Core application is horizontally scaled and the hosted drain worker is registered in every replica.

## Summary decision

For the current release line, the default outbox drain remains a single-worker selection-and-emit path. Multi-worker coordination is available through an explicit opt-in claim/lease path rather than a silent behavior change to the existing find APIs.

The existing `FindPendingAsync` and `FindRetryReadyAsync` APIs remain safe for single active worker usage and for local/test validation. They return candidate rows; they do not claim, lease, lock, or hide rows from another worker.

Hosts that need multiple workers against the same durable rows can opt into claim leasing by using a claim-capable store and enabling `AsiBackboneGovernanceOutboxOptions.UseClaimLeases`. Claim leases reduce duplicate selection risk for cooperating workers, but downstream provider delivery remains at-least-once unless the provider and host enforce idempotency.

The selected design direction is recorded in [Outbox Claim and Lease Design Record](outbox-claim-lease-design.md).

## Repeatable validation path

Issue #311 adds a CI-friendly EF Core validation path for concurrent outbox/lifecycle writes, retryable drain failures, and drain-worker contention:

```text
tests/AsiBackbone.EntityFrameworkCore.Tests/EfCoreOutboxConcurrencyValidationTests.cs
```

The validation deliberately confirms both sides of the reliability story:

- EF Core-backed local outbox and lifecycle records can be preserved under concurrent host-owned context writes in the tested SQLite relational path.
- Retryable provider failures remain represented as local outbox state and can be queried as retry-ready work.
- Workers that use the non-claiming drain path can still reach the same pending entry before final state is saved, so that path should not be described as exactly-once or duplicate-proof.

See [EF Core Outbox Concurrency Validation](../quality/ef-core-outbox-concurrency-validation.md) for the local command and interpretation guidance.

## Current behavior

| Area | Current behavior | Multi-worker implication |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `IAsiBackboneGovernanceOutboxStore.FindPendingAsync` | Returns pending entries ordered for delivery. | Selection only. It does not claim, lease, lock, or hide rows from another worker. |
| `IAsiBackboneGovernanceOutboxStore.FindRetryReadyAsync` | Returns retry-ready entries ordered for delivery. | Selection only. It does not prevent another worker from selecting the same entry. |
| `IAsiBackboneGovernanceOutboxClaimStore` | Adds explicit `ClaimPendingAsync`, `ClaimRetryReadyAsync`, claim completion, save, and release operations. | Cooperating workers emit only after acquiring a claim lease. Completion verifies claim owner/token before final state transition. |
| `AsiBackboneGovernanceOutboxDrain` | Uses the existing candidate path by default. When `UseClaimLeases = true`, it requires a claim-capable store and emits only after claim acquisition. | Hosts choose the behavior explicitly. Claim leasing reduces duplicate selection risk but does not create exactly-once provider delivery. |
| `EfCoreGovernanceOutboxStore` | Uses EF Core persistence and configured concurrency tokens for state updates. It also implements the claim-capable store contract with claim owner, token, claimed time, expiration, and attempt count fields. | Hosts must apply schema/migration changes before enabling claim leases. The baseline EF implementation is portable and optimistic-concurrency based; provider-specific SQL may be stronger for high throughput. |
| `InMemoryGovernanceOutboxStore` | Intended for tests, samples, and local validation. Same-entry status transitions and claim updates use single-process compare-and-swap updates. | Useful for local validation and tests only. It is not durable and does not model cross-replica infrastructure behavior. |
| Hosted drain worker | Runs wherever it is registered and enabled. | In scaled deployments, each replica may run a worker unless the host disables, partitions, or claim-coordinates it. |

## What optimistic concurrency does and does not solve

The EF Core persistence configuration marks `ConcurrencyStamp` as a concurrency token. That is useful for detecting stale updates when two contexts try to save incompatible state transitions for the same row.

However, the non-claiming drain flow performs provider emission before the final delivered/failed state is saved. Optimistic concurrency at save time cannot undo a provider call that already happened. In other words:

```text
worker A reads pending row
worker B reads same pending row
worker A emits to provider
worker B emits to provider
worker A saves delivered
worker B may hit a concurrency conflict or overwrite attempt
```

Even if the second save fails, the second provider emission may already have occurred. Treat optimistic concurrency as state-protection, not as duplicate-emission protection.

Claim leasing moves the coordination point before provider emission for cooperating workers:

```text
worker A claims row 123
worker B cannot claim row 123 while the lease is active
worker A emits to provider
worker A completes the row only if the claim token still matches
```

A crashed worker's claim becomes eligible for reclaim after `ClaimExpiresUtc`. That reclaim path is necessary for recovery, but it means provider delivery should still be treated as at-least-once.

## Recommended host patterns

### 1. Single active worker per durable outbox partition

For most hosts, the safest default is one active drain worker per shared durable outbox partition.

Common deployment patterns include:

- run the web/API replicas with `AsiBackboneGovernanceOutboxDrainWorkerOptions.Enabled = false`;
- run one dedicated worker process, job, container, or app service instance with the worker enabled;
- use platform leader election or a singleton scheduler if the hosting platform provides it;
- ensure only one replica has permission or configuration to drain a given outbox partition.

This remains the recommended pattern unless the host has designed and tested a multi-worker claim or partition strategy.

### 2. Partitioned workers

Multiple workers can be safe when each worker owns a disjoint outbox partition. Partitions can be based on tenant, region, workload, provider path, shard, or another host-owned routing key.

Partitioning must be enforced in the durable selection query or storage adapter. Merely giving workers different names is not enough if they still read the same pending rows.

### 3. Opt-in package claim leases before provider emission

A multi-worker durable store can claim work before calling the provider when the configured store implements `IAsiBackboneGovernanceOutboxClaimStore`.

```csharp
builder.Services.Configure<AsiBackboneGovernanceOutboxOptions>(options =>
{
    options.UseClaimLeases = true;
    options.ClaimWorkerId = "worker-1";
    options.ClaimLeaseDuration = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5);
});
```

When claim leases are enabled, the drain:

- claims pending work before provider emission;
- claims retry-ready work before provider emission;
- emits only claimed entries;
- completes delivered, deferred, failed, retryable, or dead-letter transitions only when the claim token still matches;
- allows expired claims to be reclaimed by another worker.

Hosts using EF Core must add the claim columns and indexes to their host-owned migration before enabling this option in production.

### 4. Provider-side idempotency

Even with a claim strategy, downstream providers should be treated as at-least-once targets unless the provider and host have a verified exactly-once model.

Use stable identifiers where available:

- `GovernanceEmissionEnvelope.EnvelopeId`;
- `GovernanceOutboxEntry.OutboxEntryId`;
- source event or audit residue identifiers;
- provider idempotency keys, when the provider supports them;
- provider record IDs returned after delivery.

Provider idempotency is especially important for retry, recovery, replay, lease expiration, and manual re-drain operations.

## Provider-specific SQL patterns

The baseline EF Core claim implementation is provider-neutral and optimistic-concurrency based. Provider-specific locking and skip-locked semantics may still be stronger for high-throughput deployments.

Examples that hosts may evaluate in their own infrastructure include:

- PostgreSQL-style `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`;
- SQL Server patterns using `UPDLOCK`, `READPAST`, and appropriate transaction isolation;
- database-specific atomic `UPDATE ... OUTPUT` / `RETURNING` claim statements;
- cloud queue visibility timeouts or lease-based message claims.

These patterns are useful, but they are not provider-neutral. They also require testing with the host's actual database provider, isolation level, indexes, retry policy, and migration process.

## Worker configuration guidance

`AddAsiBackboneGovernanceOutboxDrainWorker` should be treated as an operational registration. In multi-replica applications, do not assume it becomes singleton across replicas.

Recommended single-worker configuration posture:

```csharp
builder.Services.Configure<AsiBackboneGovernanceOutboxDrainWorkerOptions>(options =>
{
    options.Enabled = builder.Configuration.GetValue<bool>("AsiBackbone:OutboxDrain:Enabled");
    options.BatchSize = 100;
    options.PollingInterval = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30);
});
```

Then set `AsiBackbone:OutboxDrain:Enabled` to `true` only for the selected worker role or selected partition owner.

Recommended claim-capable configuration posture:

```csharp
builder.Services.Configure<AsiBackboneGovernanceOutboxOptions>(options =>
{
    options.UseClaimLeases = true;
    options.ClaimWorkerId = builder.Configuration["AsiBackbone:OutboxDrain:WorkerId"];
    options.ClaimLeaseDuration = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5);
});
```

Ensure the configured worker ID is stable enough to diagnose ownership but unique enough to distinguish concurrent workers.

## Operational checks

Hosts should monitor for signals that may indicate accidental duplicate workers or unsafe claim behavior:

- more worker heartbeats than expected for a partition;
- duplicate provider records with the same envelope or outbox entry identifier;
- repeated EF Core concurrency exceptions during outbox state transitions;
- provider throttling caused by duplicate drain attempts;
- delivered records without the expected provider record IDs;
- rising retry/dead-letter counts after a scale-out event;
- claims that remain active until expiration without completion;
- frequent claim reclaims that may indicate worker crashes, too-short leases, or slow provider calls.

If duplicate workers are discovered, disable extra workers first, then inspect provider-side duplicates and outbox state before replaying records.

## Wording boundary

Do not describe the provider-neutral outbox drain as exactly-once delivery.

A safer description is:

> AsiBackbone provides durable local outbox records, provider-neutral drain primitives, and opt-in claim/lease coordination for cooperating workers. Hosts must still use partitioning, host-owned migrations, and provider-side idempotency appropriate to their deployment to avoid or collapse duplicate emissions.

This keeps the package boundary clear and avoids overstating delivery guarantees.

## Continuing design considerations

Claim/lease support is now an implemented baseline rather than only a future design item, but some questions remain host- or provider-specific:

- whether the baseline EF Core optimistic-concurrency claim path is sufficient for a given production workload;
- how to avoid breaking existing host-owned migrations and deployed schemas;
- how provider idempotency keys should flow into downstream emitters;
- how tests should model real database concurrency beyond in-memory concurrency;
- whether later operational evidence justifies provider-specific claim packages or a new provider-neutral `Claimed` or `InProgress` status.

Production multi-replica hosts should choose one active worker, partitioned workers, or the opt-in claim/lease behavior with provider-side idempotency.
