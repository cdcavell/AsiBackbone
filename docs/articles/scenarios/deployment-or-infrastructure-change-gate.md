# Deployment or Infrastructure Change Gate Scenario

AsiBackbone can help a platform or operations host evaluate deployment and infrastructure-change requests before the host calls its own automation systems.

This scenario is useful when a change is consequential enough that the host needs policy context, acknowledgment, escalation, or audit residue before continuing.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> AsiBackbone is not a deployment engine, infrastructure automation tool, scheduler, cloud provider SDK, or change-management system. The host owns deployment logic, environment access, rollback, and operational safeguards. AsiBackbone provides a governance decision boundary before the host proceeds.

## Responsibility boundary

| Participant | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Requesting actor or pipeline | Proposes a deployment, maintenance, or configuration action. |
| Host platform | Owns environment data, automation tooling, rollback, and execution. |
| AsiBackbone | Evaluates the host-provided policy context and returns a governance decision. |
| Acknowledgment layer | Handles responsibility acknowledgment when the decision requires it. |
| Audit sink or ledger | Preserves decision residue, reason codes, policy metadata, and correlation data. |
| Automation system | Executes only if the host decides the governed action may proceed. |

## Sequence

```text
Requesting actor or pipeline
  -> Host platform: proposes deployment or infrastructure change
  -> Host platform: builds policy context from actor, environment, risk, and metadata
  -> AsiBackbone evaluator: evaluates policy context
  -> Host platform: receives governance decision

If denied, deferred, or escalation-recommended:
  -> Host platform persists decision residue
  -> Host platform returns governed outcome without execution

If acknowledgment-required:
  -> Host platform presents acknowledgment challenge
  -> Acknowledgment layer returns accepted or rejected response
  -> Host platform persists decision and acknowledgment residue
  -> Host platform runs automation only if accepted and host policy permits execution

If allowed or warning:
  -> Host platform persists decision residue
  -> Host platform decides whether and how to run host-owned automation
```

## Example changes

| Proposed change | Example policy factors | Example governance posture |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Promote release | environment, release version, change window, actor type | Allow standard promotion paths; require acknowledgment for production changes. |
| Apply configuration update | target system, config category, risk level, correlation ID | Defer missing metadata; escalate sensitive configuration changes. |
| Run maintenance job | job name, environment, schedule, policy version | Allow routine jobs; require acknowledgment for disruptive maintenance. |
| Trigger external automation | target platform, operation type, execution scope | Deny unsafe operations; continue only after policy approval. |

## Implementation notes

The host should build the policy context before invoking deployment or infrastructure automation. Useful metadata may include environment, operation name, target system, change window, release version, ticket identifier, actor type, risk category, policy version, policy hash, and correlation identifier.

AsiBackbone can return a decision that the host maps into a pipeline status, approval step, service response, or change-management workflow. The host remains responsible for enforcing the outcome and running automation.

## What this pattern helps prevent

- Privileged automation that runs before policy context is evaluated.
- Deployment decisions that cannot be tied back to reason codes or policy versions.
- Approval steps disconnected from audit residue.
- Broad automation authority without a bounded governance decision.
- Scattered one-off checks across scripts, pipelines, and service endpoints.

## Adoption note

Start with a simulated or low-impact pipeline action. Let the host evaluate the proposed change, persist the decision, and return a governed result before placing the pattern in front of production automation.
