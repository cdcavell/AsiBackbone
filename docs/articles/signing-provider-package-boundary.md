# Signing Provider Package Boundary

This article documents the stable signing-provider package boundary carried forward into the current AsiBackbone `3.x` package family.

Issue: #253, updated for #512.

In this software project, **ASI** means **Accountable Systems Infrastructure**. AsiBackbone is a governance spine for consequential software decision flow. It is not a signing appliance, key-management system, immutable ledger, blockchain service, legal non-repudiation system, or compliance certification service by itself.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Signing-related package surfaces do not make records tamper-evident, immutable, legally non-repudiable, or compliance-certified by default. Those claims require concrete signing, verification, durable storage controls, key management, retention, monitoring, and operational procedures supplied by the host or provider environment.

## Purpose

Core exposes provider-neutral signing and verification seams while concrete key-management integrations live outside `AsiBackbone.Core`.

The signing-provider boundary exists so hosts can choose local-development signing, the managed-key adapter, or organization-owned signing implementations without forcing every AsiBackbone consumer to take dependencies on Azure, cloud KMS SDKs, certificate stores, hardware security modules, local key files, or blockchain services.

## Released package posture

The released signing-related package surfaces are:

| Package | Purpose | Production posture |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AsiBackbone.Core` | Provider-neutral signing-ready metadata, canonical payload/hash contracts, signing request/result contracts, verification request/result contracts, and verification-policy primitives. | Stable primitives only. Core does not own production key custody, concrete provider clients, immutable storage, or compliance guarantees. |
| `AsiBackbone.Signing.LocalDevelopment` | Local-development RSA signing and verification for tests, samples, deterministic local validation, and wiring proof paths. | Not production. No protected key custody. Not appropriate for production tamper-evidence. |
| `AsiBackbone.Signing.ManagedKey` | Provider-neutral managed-key signing adapter that delegates actual signing to a host-owned managed-key client. | Production-capable only when the host supplies a secure managed-key client, credentials, policies, monitoring, and verification path. |

## Production runtime signing roadmap

The approved production runtime signing-provider story is **provider-neutral only**.

AsiBackbone documents how hosts can connect Azure Key Vault, AWS KMS, GCP Cloud KMS, HSM, certificate-store, or enterprise key-management clients through `AsiBackbone.Signing.ManagedKey`. AsiBackbone does not ship or maintain first-party production signing provider packages for those systems, and it does not ship a production-style signing sample host that could be mistaken for a supported provider implementation.

This boundary keeps AsiBackbone focused on governance flow, audit residue, canonical signing seams, safe metadata, and verification contracts while leaving key custody and provider operations with the consuming host.

## Ownership boundaries

| Layer | Owns | Must not own |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core | `IAsiBackboneSigningService`, `IAsiBackboneSignatureVerificationService`, signing requests/results, signing metadata, provider-neutral canonical payload/hash contracts, verification-policy primitives, and safe metadata fields. | Azure SDKs, HSM SDKs, cloud KMS clients, local key-file production handling, certificate stores, credentials, raw keys, managed identity tokens, immutable storage, blockchain anchoring, legal interpretation, or compliance certification. |
| Local-development signing provider | Deterministic local signing/verification proof path, test/sample wiring, and local metadata assertions. | Production key custody, managed-key behavior, legal non-repudiation, immutability, or tamper-evidence. |
| Managed-key adapter package | Adapter service, provider options, DI registration helpers, algorithm mapping, key reference validation, provider diagnostics, and provider-specific failure handling around a host-owned client. | Concrete Azure Key Vault/HSM/KMS client implementation by default, first-party production provider packages, production-style signing sample hosts, host policy decisions, host authentication, host authorization, durable audit ownership, database migrations, retention policy, or claims that records are tamper-evident by default. |
| Host application | Configuration source, key identity, managed-key client implementation, provider credentials or managed identity, production failure policy, logging policy, persistence lifecycle, deployment, monitoring, verification path, and incident response. | Requiring Core to know provider secrets or making Core responsible for operational key management. |
| Samples/tests | Non-production proof path for wiring, fake/local signatures, and stable metadata assertions. | Production security claims or production-style key-management guidance. |

## Required host-owned provider responsibilities

A host-owned concrete signing client should:

- accept a `SigningRequest` containing a precomputed artifact hash;
- validate that the requested hash algorithm is supported;
- sign only the precomputed hash, not raw protected content;
- return `SigningResult` containing provider-neutral `SigningMetadata`;
- preserve `SigningHash`, `HashAlgorithm`, `Signature`, `SignatureAlgorithm`, `KeyId`, `KeyVersion`, `Provider`, and `SignedUtc` whenever available;
- include only safe metadata such as provider operation ID, key URI reference, or algorithm descriptor when those values are safe to persist;
- avoid returning private keys, symmetric keys, connection strings, access tokens, credentials, managed identity tokens, or raw secret material to Core;
- honor cancellation tokens;
- avoid logging signing hashes together with sensitive operational metadata unless the host has explicitly accepted that logging posture;
- document whether missing key versions, disabled keys, revoked keys, provider timeouts, unsupported algorithms, and unavailable providers fail closed, throw, or return an unsigned result.

A concrete verifier should:

- verify a supplied signing hash against provider-neutral signing metadata;
- use key ID and key version whenever available;
- distinguish invalid signatures, hash mismatches, missing signatures, unknown key versions, unsupported algorithms, provider unavailability, and revoked or disabled keys where the provider can detect them;
- avoid silently treating unverifiable records as trusted.

## Dependency direction

The dependency graph must stay one-way:

```text
AsiBackbone.Core
        ^
        |
AsiBackbone.Signing.LocalDevelopment
        ^
        |
Host application, sample, or test
```

```text
AsiBackbone.Core
        ^
        |
AsiBackbone.Signing.ManagedKey
        ^
        |
Host-owned managed-key client
```

Core must never reference the provider package. Provider packages reference Core.

## Recommended signing flow

```text
Governance artifact
  -> build canonical payload
  -> compute canonical payload hash
  -> create SigningRequest from hash metadata
  -> provider signs precomputed hash
  -> provider returns SigningMetadata
  -> host attaches metadata to selected audit/outbox artifact
  -> host persists durable record
  -> optional verifier later checks hash + signature + key reference
```

Hashing and signing should remain separate steps. A hashed record is not signed. A signed record is not verified until verification runs. A signed and verified record is not automatically tamper-evident unless durable storage, chain/anchor strategy, key handling, and operational procedures support that claim.

## Local-development signer boundary

`AsiBackbone.Signing.LocalDevelopment` is a released stable package for:

- proving DI registration and host wiring;
- exercising signing metadata flow in samples;
- running deterministic tests without live cloud resources;
- documenting how a provider maps request fields into `SigningMetadata`.

It must remain clearly marked:

- local only;
- sample/test only;
- not backed by protected key storage;
- not appropriate for production tamper-evidence;
- not proof of non-repudiation, compliance, immutability, or legal effect.

## Managed-key provider boundary

`AsiBackbone.Signing.ManagedKey` is a released stable adapter boundary. It does not include Azure Key Vault, Managed HSM, AWS KMS, GCP Cloud KMS, certificate store, HSM, or enterprise key-management behavior by default.

A production managed-key host should:

- keep private key material inside the key-management boundary;
- prefer managed identity, workload identity, service account, certificate, or host-provided credentials over secrets in configuration;
- record returned or configured key ID and key version;
- document algorithm mapping between Core descriptors and provider-specific algorithms;
- document retry and timeout behavior;
- keep live provider integration tests optional and disabled by default;
- document key rotation and retired-key verification behavior;
- document how verification is performed after signing.

## Failure handling guidance

Provider packages should avoid ambiguous failure behavior.

| Condition | Recommended default |
| --- | --- |
| Missing key ID | Throw configuration exception during provider setup or first signing call. |
| Missing key version when required | Fail closed or return explicit unsigned failure metadata according to host policy. |
| Unsupported hash algorithm | Fail the signing operation; do not silently sign under a different algorithm. |
| Unsupported signature algorithm | Fail the signing operation; document supported descriptors. |
| Provider unavailable | Fail closed for production-required signing unless the host explicitly allows optional signing. |
| Local-development signer used in production | Warn in documentation and package naming; hosts remain responsible for environment gating. |
| Raw key material requested by Core | Not allowed. Core should never request it. |

`SigningResult.NoSignature` or unsigned failure metadata should be reserved for intentionally unsigned or optional-signing flows. Production-required signing should not silently downgrade to unsigned behavior.

## Non-goals

This boundary does not provide:

- Azure Key Vault, AWS KMS, GCP Cloud KMS, Managed HSM, cloud KMS, HSM, certificate-store, or hardware signing integration by default;
- first-party production signing provider packages;
- production-style signing sample hosts;
- automatic key rotation;
- credential management;
- automatic verification policy;
- immutable storage;
- blockchain anchoring;
- legal non-repudiation;
- compliance certification;
- tamper-proof or tamper-evident records by default.
