# ASI Backbone Documentation

Welcome to the AsiBackbone documentation site.

In this software project, **ASI** means **Accountable Systems Infrastructure**. AsiBackbone is a .NET governance and policy-control package family implemented as practical software infrastructure. The project is a governance spine, not an intelligence engine.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> AsiBackbone provides framework-neutral building blocks and host integration seams for governing consequential actions in software systems. Host applications remain responsible for authentication, authorization, execution, persistence, deployment, monitoring, compliance review, and operational controls. For the canonical boundary reference, see [Project Boundaries and Non-Claims](articles/project-boundaries.md).

## Search, navigation, and source links

The documentation site uses the DocFX search box in the header. Source for every page lives in the repository under `docs/`, and the site header includes a Repository link for viewing or editing documentation files.

## Start here

These pages are the best first stops for implementation-first adoption.

## Current stable package family

Stable `2.x` is the current release line. `2.3.0` is the current compatible minor release. It preserves the `2.0.0` public package and namespace boundary while adding metadata budget guardrails, opt-in constraint-exception denial behavior, empty-policy warning diagnostics, managed-key signing fail-closed defaults, outbox/query hardening, endpoint-governance validation cleanup, and documentation alignment.

AsiBackbone.EntityFrameworkCore
AsiBackbone.AspNetCore
AsiBackbone.Testing

```

Package-specific READMEs and release notes define which surfaces are stable, optional, local-only, or future-facing. A design page being present in the documentation does not mean the corresponding provider package has shipped as stable.
