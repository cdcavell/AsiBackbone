# External Consumer Smoke Test

The external consumer smoke test validates AsiBackbone from the perspective of a fresh host application that consumes package-shaped artifacts instead of repository-internal project references.

This check exists to answer a pre-release confidence question:

> Can a clean consumer-style host wire the packages with minimal steps while preserving host-owned boundaries?

## What the smoke test validates

The smoke test script packs the projects under `src/` into local `.nupkg` files, creates a temporary xUnit project outside the solution structure, installs the local packages through a temporary `NuGet.config`, and runs HTTP-based assertions through `Microsoft.AspNetCore.TestHost`.

The generated consumer project validates:

- Core + ASP.NET Core adapter registration through `AddAsiBackboneAspNetCore()`;
- no package-owned MVC, auth, or EF provider assumptions;
- a host-owned `DbContext` that applies AsiBackbone EF Core model configuration;
- the EF Core audit ledger path through `EfCoreAuditLedgerStore`;
- the in-memory audit path through `InMemoryAuditLedger` for a minimal non-durable host;
- allow, deny, and require-acknowledgment decision flows over HTTP.

The stable package integration smoke script also generates focused xUnit tests for the `1.0.0` release path:

- Core + `Storage.InMemory` decision/audit composition through public package APIs;
- a host-defined stub implementation of `IAsiBackboneAuditSink`;
- ASP.NET Core + EF Core + SQLite host-owned workflow composition.

These checks intentionally avoid outbox, provider emission, cloud telemetry, or other behavior deferred beyond the initial stable package family.

## Run locally

From the repository root:

```bash
bash ./eng/smoke-tests/external-consumer-smoke.sh
bash ./eng/smoke-tests/stable-package-integration-smoke.sh
```

The scripts write package artifacts to:

```text
artifacts/packages
artifacts/stable-smoke-packages
```

They create temporary external consumer projects under the operating system temporary directory by default. Set `SMOKE_WORK_ROOT` or `STABLE_SMOKE_WORK_ROOT` to override those locations.

Both locations are safe to delete after the run.

## Workflow

The GitHub Actions workflow is defined at:

```text
.github/workflows/external-consumer-smoke.yml
```

The workflow runs both smoke scripts on push, pull request, and manual dispatch.

## Boundary expectations

This smoke test intentionally avoids adding project references to the generated consumer test project. The generated project should behave like an outside adopter using packages.

The EF Core path remains host-owned:

- the host declares its own `SmokeHostDbContext` or `StableSmokeDbContext`;
- the host chooses SQLite for the smoke test;
- the host calls `ApplyAsiBackboneConfigurations()` from its own `OnModelCreating` method;
- the host registers its `DbContext` as the `DbContext` consumed by `EfCoreAuditLedgerStore`.

The non-durable path remains explicit:

- the host registers `InMemoryAuditLedger`;
- the host maps it to `IAsiBackboneAuditSink`;
- the smoke test verifies that in-memory records are written alongside EF ledger records where that path is under test.

## Decision flows

The HTTP smoke path exercises three outcomes:

| Route | Expected outcome | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/decisions/allow` | `Allowed` | Confirms a routine request can proceed and is written to both audit paths. |
| `/decisions/deny` | `Denied` | Confirms host-defined constraint failure blocks execution and preserves reason codes. |
| `/decisions/ack` | `AcknowledgmentRequired` | Confirms host-defined decision policy can require acknowledgment before execution. |

The stable package integration smoke path adds explicit package-composition assertions for:

| Test | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Core + in-memory decision/audit composition | Confirms the Core evaluator and in-memory ledger can be consumed together from packages. |
| Stubbed audit sink | Confirms a consuming application can implement `IAsiBackboneAuditSink` without internal dependencies. |
| ASP.NET Core + EF Core + SQLite host wiring | Confirms host-owned web and persistence integration remains package-consumer friendly. |

## Pre-release use

Run these smoke tests before packaging or release-candidate validation. A failure usually means one of the following changed:

- package dependency metadata;
- DI registration ergonomics;
- host-owned EF Core integration boundaries;
- in-memory storage registration expectations;
- minimal HTTP host behavior;
- public audit sink or evaluator composition contracts.

Treat failures as package-consumer issues first, not sample-host issues, because the generated smoke projects are deliberately outside the solution's normal project-reference graph.
